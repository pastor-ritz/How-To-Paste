## How To Paste
My all in one guide that help you make your first working paste

> Learning C++ basics 
- It is more than essential that you know basic c++. It might not make sense at first but as you paste and use the things you learn it will make sense.
- start by watching a basic course https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLnPwxZdW4Y
- everyday watch this playlist and try to learn something new https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18c3MTX0PK0&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb
- if you prefer to read instead of watch then you can go to learncpp.com

> Drivers?
- All of the information your cheat is taking in is done by reading memory from fortnite
- Fortnite has a kernel leve anti cheat which means you wont be able to read and write from ring 3 (ring 3 is where your cheat is)
- to read and write you will need to do it from kernel, so u need a kernel driver 
- your driver must also be albe to communicate with your cheat so the cheat can recive the information that the driver has read. This is known as your communication method and the most effective way for the anti cheat to detect your driver. But it is also only one of the many ways they can detect your driver. You might have heard that iotcl drivers are detected. iotcl is the communication method that the driver is using. This misinformation has been thrown around because someone uploaded to github and driver source that was using iotcl and everything about it was detected. You need to understand that while on driver using iotcl may be detected it doesnt mean all are. If you make your own driver that is iotcl and use your own method for it that is not public and doesnt have any detection vectors, then your iotcl driver wont be detected. Iotcl is actaully a very good communication method because most legit(drivers that arent used by cheats) are using iotcl.
